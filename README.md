# About this branch
Modified by NiniTechnology. Some additional features and functions will be added in the future to optimize the user experience.

## Original log lines as trigger event source
Add a new Trigger event source "Original log lines", which allow triggers to access raw log lines. Raw log lines contains more information and they can be useful when we need to test our triggers. They often have information like this: 

```
251|2019-05-21T19:11:02.0268703-07:00|ProcessTCPInfo: New connection detected for Process [2644]:192.168.1.70:49413=>204.2.229.85:55021|909171c500bed915f8d79fc04d3589fa
```

## Additional math functions
```
X8float = converts a base16 (hex) 4-bytes array to float types.
X4pos = converts a base16 (hex) uint16 types to a ffxiv ingame-position expression as follows: pos = (uint16 - 32767)/32.767, this is used in ActorCast type network packet.
```

## Reduction of combatant states update interval
Reduce update interval of combatant stats to 10ms (from original 1000ms), Enhance the real-time performance of memory data. But it is still limited by the memory update interval of ffxiv_act_plugin, which is 100ms.

## Customizable encounter format
Modify ExportActiveEncounter and ExportLastEncounter function. Now we have encounter information in the selected miniparse format instead of default format.
```
_lastencounter = ACT DPS information from the last encounter in selected miniparse format
_activeencounter = ACT DPS information from the ongoing encounter in selected miniparse format
```

## More combatant properties available
Add more Properties available in _ffxivparty and _ffxiventity:
```
name = Name of the actor
job = Current job as a three letter acronym (AST, CUL, MIN, SMN, etc)
jobid = Numeric (internal ingame) representation of the current job
currenthp, currentmp, currentcp, currentgp = Current HP, MP, CP, and GP
maxhp, maxmp, maxcp, maxgp = Maximum HP, MP, CP, and GP
level = Level of the actor
x, y, and z = Position information of the actor
inparty = Party membership flag (0 = character doesn't exist or is not in party, 1 = character exists and is in the party)
id = Hexadecimal ID of the actor
order = Order number of the actor inside the _ffxivparty structure (this property is 0 for _ffxiventity)
worldid = Numeric ID of the home world of the character
worldname = Name of the home world of the character
currentworldid = Numeric ID of the current world of the character
heading = Heading of the entity in radians (South 0, North Â±PI)
targetid = Hexadecimal ID of the actor currently selected as target (0 is there is no target selected)
casttargetid = Hexadecimal ID of the actor the current cast is targetting (0 is there is no cast in progress)
distance = Distance from the main combatant (you) to the entity
role = Role of the actor ("Tank", "Healer", "DPS", "Crafter", "Gatherer", or blank if not available)

ownerid
type
iscasting = (0 = character is not casting, 1 = character is casting)
castbuffid
castdurationcurrent
castdurationmax
bnpcnameid
bnpcid
pointer = Hexadecimal pointer address of character data in memory.
```

## Direct Memory Reading Function
Add Combatant Memory Reading Function. This is a dangerous function which can read all the memory information of a certain combatant. Starting from the memory pointer, read every 16 Bytes (1234ABCD) as a unit. The result is returned as a string value. 
```
_ffxiventity[1234ABCD].memory[8,4] = Begin at 8 units offsets from memory pointer address, and read 4 units. 
```
The memory structure of a combatant is listed below as a reference. This code is copied from FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.Memory.Models.Combatant64Struct.
